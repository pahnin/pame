PAME -- PHP App Made Easy

To build php apps easily and rapidly, we're working on this project to make a platform
to write you modules where each and every part of your site is a module.

Also we are gonna write different module bundles for different types of web sites.

Why is this started?

When I thought of making the site with existing CMSs & Frame works, I was a newbie to PHP application develop ment, and I found it very difficult to hack(change or modify) the core functinality or some parts of the application. 

All of them are too much complicated to understand.

Reducing the complications pame is in development, where you can write you own fully functional, simple, less complicated app in minutes.

In future we're thinking of starting an module store where developers can share their modules.

So if you dont like the interface of module written by a developer you can replace it with another.

Documentation to develop your sites using this PHP engine will be provided soon.
